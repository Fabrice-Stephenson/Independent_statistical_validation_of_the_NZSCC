R CODE:
1. Independent statistical validation of the NZSCC.R  - code used to validate the NZSCC (including assessing the classification strength and underlying statistical model of the NZSCC
														considering the heterogeneity in environmental coverage and statistical uncertainty).
2. Pairwise_adonis.R - custom function to run pairwise permanova tests to test for between group differences

DATA:

DF.source - Independent evaluation data for demersal fish (for years 2019 - 2022)

NZSCC.zip - zipped folder containing spatial data layers from the NZSCC (Stephenson et al., 2022) for validation available upon request (too large to post here)
